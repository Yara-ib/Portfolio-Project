## Development

* Frontend Integration: Moving forward, I will focus on integrating the backend API with the frontend.
* User Notifications: Setting up real-time notifications for users about order updates, new blog posts, and service changes.
* Monitoring System: Integrate a monitoring system to handle logs, monitor server health, and track application performance. This will allow for proactive issue detection and smoother maintenance.
* Subscription System for Service Providers: Iâ€™ll be implementing a subscription system using Stripe to enable service providers to subscribe to. This system will include secure payment processing, and customizable subscription plans.
* Real-Time Chat for Customer Service: Implement a real-time chat feature to enhance customer support, allowing users to connect directly with support representatives.
